            <h2>Freeman Robert Allan Schlichting</h2>
            <hr>
                <h3>Short Biography:</h3>
                <p>I was born in Illinois.  We moved about ten times by the time I was ten.<br>
                During that time I lived in the states of Illinois, Wisconsin, South Carolina,<br>
                and of course Iowa.</p>
                <p>My parents bought the family farm when I was ten and they have lived there since.<br>
                The family farm was a seed corn farm while I was growing up, but it is now currently<br>
                a certified organic farm.</p>
            <section>
                <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>I was homeschooled K-12.  I graduated from the Vinton-Shellsburg<br>
                    Homeschool Program in 2005.  One of the advantages of being homeschooled<br>
                    was that I was able to focus more on things that interested me at the time.<br>
                    One of the things that highly interested me and still interests me is<br>
                    the prarie.  I took on a project of converting a section of road ditch to<br>
                    native prarie plants</p>
                    <p>I then went on to Kirkwood Community College and I got a two year degree<br>
                    in Parks and Natural Resources, in 2009.  I enjoyed my classes a lot but I<br>
                    failed to find a career path in that field that I could see myself doing for<br>
                    a considerable amount of time.</p>
                    <p>I then attened Iowa State University for one and a half years.</p>
                    <p>After attending Iowa State University I went back to Kirkwood Community<br>
                    College.  I earned a certificate in entrepreneurship.  I explored a number<br>
                    of entrepreneurial ideas, but I never got anything off the ground.  After<br>
                    exploring entrepreneurship for a number of years and working odd jobs, I <br>
                    find myself ready to be the best programmer I can be and to settle into a<br>
                    good job.</p>
                    <p>I'm currently attending DeltaV Code School, Iowa's premier coding school.</p>
                <h3>Job Experience</h3>
                    <p>I first entered the workforce at the tender age of seven!  I worked for my<br>
                    grandpa walking the cornfields with my family and the other workers for about <br>
                    half a day at a time.  I have worked on the family farm quite a bit more since<br>
                    my parents purchased it when I was ten.  I have detasseled seed corn for eight<br>
                    summers!  Since I graduated high school I have worked on the farm off and on in<br>
                    between other jobs and school.</p>
                    <p>I worked as a teacher's assistant at a day care facility between high<br>
                    school and before attending Kirkwood Community College.  I have also worked<br>
                    as a pizza delivery driver while attending school.  I then worked for Classic<br>
                    Lawn Care for a summer.  The next summer I had an interesting, but good experience<br>
                    overall working for the Americorps - Trail Crew.  I mainly helped build trails<br>
                    at the Mines of Spain Recreation Area, in Dubuques, Iowa.  The following summer<br>
                    I worked for Linn County Conservation, at Pinicon Ridge Park, in Central City,<br>
                    Iowa.</p>
                    <p>I have also worked a season as a security guard for PerMar Security, for<br>
                    the Iowa home football games.  I was also a food runner for the restaurants<br>
                    Jiamen Innovative Asian Cusine and LAVA when they both were starting out.<br>
                    I have worked a few other odd jobs as well.  My most recent job off the farm<br>
                    was for Color Web Printer/The Gazette as a distribution coordinator.</p>
